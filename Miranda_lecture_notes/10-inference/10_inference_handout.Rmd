## Confidence intervals

For a 95% CI, let's look at the interval with area 0.95 on the standard normal curve.  The area outside is 0.05, which means each tail has area 0.05/2 = 0.025. 

Find these values with `qnorm`:

```{r}
qnorm(0.025)
qnorm(0.975)
```

What if we wanted to build a 90% CI?

```{r}
# qnorm()
# qnorm()
```


## Hypothesis testing

In the "Lady tasting tea" example, if Bristol is guessing randomly, the number of correct guessses is Binom(8, 0.5).

If she gets 6 out of 8 correct, then the p-value is the sum of the binomial probabilities greater than or equal to 6.

```{r}
1 - pbinom(5, 8, 0.5)
```

What is the p-value if she gets 8 out of 8 correct?

```{r}
# pbinom()
```
