# Preliminaries

- This file should be in `STAT240/homework/hw11` on your local computer.
- Download `happiness_2019.csv` and `dc_weather.csv` to `STAT240/data`.


# Problem 1

A one-sided hypothesis test of 

$$H_A: \beta_1 > 0$$

is performed on a linear model.  The p-value of this test is 0.035.  What would be the p-value if the same data was used to test the following alternatives?

(a) $$H_A: \beta_1 < 0$$

(b) $$H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$$


# Problem 2

Continue working with the happiness index vs GDP of countries model from Homework 10.

```{r}
happiness <- read_csv("../../data/happiness_2019.csv")

# Remove spaces from column names
names(happiness) <- make.names(names(happiness))

happiness_mod <- lm(Score ~ GDP.per.capita, data = happiness)
```

Build and interpret a 98% CI for the true slope of the linear relationship between happiness index and GDP.  Does the interval cover 0?


# Problem 3

(a) Perform a hypothesis test of hypotheses $$H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \quad \text{versus}\quad H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$$ for the slope of the happiness model.  What is the test statistic, p-value, and conclusion at the 2% level?

(b) How do the results of the hypothesis test in problem 3 relate to the results of the confidence interval in problem 2?


# Problem 4

26 measurements of outside low temperature (in C) and gas consumption (in 1000's of cubic feet) are taken for a house in England.  A linear model was fit to relate gas consumption to outside temperature.  Use the coefficient table of the lm summary output given in `hw11p4.png` to answer the following questions.

(a) Complete a test at the 5% level to determine whether the slope of the linear relationship between gas consumption and temperature is less than -0.3.  Include hypotheses, test statistic, p-value, and a conclusion.

(b) The 11th point in the data has a residual value of 0.17.  Does the linear model overestimate or underestimate the gas consumption on that day?

(c) The outside low temperature on the day when the 11th point of data was recorded was 5.4 degrees C.  How much gas was actually consumed on this day?

(d) We know that the standard deviation of the temperature measurements are larger than the standard deviation of the gas consumption measurements.  Which of the four statements is true about the correlation between temperature and gas consumption, and why?

- The correlation is between -1 and -0.393.
- The correlation is between -0.393 and 0.
- The correlation is between 0 and 0.393.
- The correlation is between 0.393 and 1.


# Problem 5

Which of the following conditions lead to a smaller prediction error?  Briefly explain your chocies.

- A smaller sample size vs a larger sample size

- A smaller value of $\sigma$ vs a larger value of $\sigma$

- Predicting closer to $\bar{x}$ vs predicting further from $\bar{x}$

- A smaller variance vs a larger variance in the original $X$ data


# Problem 6

Consider predicting the happiness index of a country with 1 GDP per capita.

(a) Build a *prediction interval* for the happiness index of a new country with $x^* = 1$ GDP per capita.  You can use the `predict()` function.

(b) Build a *confidence interval* for the height of the regression line at $x^* = 1$.  You can use the `predict()` function.

(c) Explain the difference in how the prediction and confidence intervals are calculated.


# Problem 7

The file `dc_weather.csv` contains weather data for Washington, DC from August 2018 to August 2024. 

```{r}
weather <- read_csv("../../data/dc_weather.csv")
```

(a) Make a plot of minimum temperature (in C) on the x axis versus dew point on the y axis.  Comment on the shape of the data.

(b) Use R's `lm()` to fit a linear model for dew point in terms of minimum temperature.  Perform a residual analysis to assess the validity of this model.


# Problem 8

We want to test whether the slope of the linear relationship between minimum temperature and dew point is greater than 1.  Write hypotheses corresponding to the question of interest and carry out the test on the weather data.  Make a conclusion with $\alpha = 0.05$.
