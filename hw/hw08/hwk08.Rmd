# Problem 1

We wish to test whether the average person is shorter than the average NBA player. We have data for the whole population of NBA players and know their average height to be 6'6" (78 inches). Let the average height of a non-player be $\mu$.

(a) What are the null and alternative hypotheses for this test?

(b) The Central Limit Theorem says the sample mean of n individuals is approximated by  $N\Big(\mu, \; \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$, where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the expectation and standard deviation of the population. Assume $\sigma$, the standard deviation of all non-player heights, is 4 inches. If the null hypothesis was true, what is the distribution of the sample mean of the heights of 5 non-players? 


# Problem 2

We wish to test whether the average person is shorter than the average NBA player. We have data for the whole population of NBA players and know their average height to be 6'6" (78 inches). Let the average height of a non-player be $\mu$.

(a) We sample 5 non-players and get the heights (70, 61, 63, 65, 72). What is the sample mean? What is the probability of getting a sample mean smaller than this on the distribution from problem 2?

(b) What do we conclude about the average height of non-players compared to the average height of an NBA player? Are we completely 100% certain of that conclusion?


# Problem 3

We wish to test whether over 75% of UW-Madison students drink caffeine by taking a random sample of 45 students.

$$H_0: p = 0.75 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: p > 0.75$$

We'll use significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

(a) After completing our survey, we will get $x$, our test statistic, the number of students out of 45 that drink caffeine.  Find the *rejection threshold* for our test. In other words, what values of $x$ on the $Binom(45, 0.75)$ null distribution lead us to reject the null hypothesis?

(b) Suppose the true $p = 0.85$.  Based on what you found in (a), what is the probability that we reject $H_0$ from our sample of 45?

(c) The probability calculated in (b) is the "true positive rate", called *power*. If we decrease $\alpha$ to 0.01, will the power increase or decrease?  How can you tell without having to re-calculate (a) and (b)?


# Problem 4

The file `superbowl_commercials.csv` contains a list of advertisements for 10 brands aired during Super Bowls from 2000 to 2020.  Each advertisement is classified according to several characterisitcs.  More information can be found  [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads).

Transform the data as follows:

- Group the rows by brand
- Count the number of ads described as "Funny"
- Count the total number of ads
- Find the proportion of "Funny" ads for each brand
- Save the dataset to your environment for the later problems
- Print the dataset

```{r}
commercials <- read_csv("../../data/superbowl_commercials.csv")
```


# Problem 5

Starting from the dataset created in problem 4, count the total number of ads in the dataset, as well as the total number of "Funny" ads.  Build and interpret a 99% CI for $p_{funny}$, the overall proportion of funny ads across all of the brands.  Use the Agresti-Coull adjustment.


# Problem 6

Repeat the analysis in problem 5, but build a 99% CI fo for $p_{funny}$ with the Wald adjustment.  How do the two intervals compare?


# Problem 7

Perform a hypothesis test to determine whether more than half of superbowl ads are funny.  Use hyoptheses
$$H_0: p_{funny} = 0.5 \quad \text{versus}\quad H_A: p_{funny} > 0.5$$
and $\alpha = 0.01$.  Interpret your result in context.


# Problem 8

State the model and assumptions you used to perform inference on $p_{funny}$ in problems 5-7.  State one criticism where reality may differ from the assumptions, potentially leading to misleading conclusions.
