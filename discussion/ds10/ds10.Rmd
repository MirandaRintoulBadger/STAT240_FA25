# Preliminaries

- This file should be in `STAT240/discussion/ds10`.
- This assignment should be completed in your discussion groups, which can be found on the "People" tab on Canvas.

The goal of today's discussion will be to think about proportion inference and one-sample mean inference in more detail.  We'll also look at dissecting confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in different ways.


# Problem 1
#### (approx. 15 minutes)

We have seen how to perform a two-sample proportion test against a difference of zero. Now, consider a test where the null difference in proportions is not zero:
$$H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0.2 \quad\text{versus}\quad H_A: p_1 - p_2 \neq 0.2$$
Show how this test would be performed if we have two groups of data with $\hat{p}_1 = 0.5$, $\hat{p}_2 = 0.35$, $n_1 = 80$, and $n_2 = 120$. Use $\alpha = 0.05$. *The test statistic is not the same as if we were testing $p_1 - p_2 = 0$!*


# Problem 2
#### (approx. 20 minutes)

In statistics, we often have an idea of what a desirable or informative result looks like. We ask, "What qualities must our analysis have to acheive this result?" Perform these calculations for the three separate examples below.

(a) Consider building a T confidence interval with $n = 35$ observations based on a sample with sample sd $s = 8.4$. What is the biggest confidence level (smallest $\alpha$) we can use if we want to have margin of error less than 3?

(b) A 95% Wald confidence interval will be used to obtain an estimate for an unknown population proportion $p$. What is the smallest sample size that will guarantee a margin of error of at most 0.08?

(c) We are performing a one-sided T hypothesis test of 
$$H_0: \mu = 5 \quad \text{versus}\quad H_A: \mu > 5$$
with $s = 43.1$ and $n = 150$. How large does the observed sample mean $\bar{x}$ need to be to see a one-sided p-value of 0.05?  *Start with the formula for a test statistic, then solve for $\bar{x}$.  What value goes on the other side of your equation?*

(d) In the previous three parts, we worked with the significance level $\alpha$, the sample size $n$, and the sample mean $\bar{X}$. Which of these three quantities would it be most logical to manipulate, as a researcher? Explain your choice.


# Problem 3
#### (approx. 10 minutes)

Using a sample of $n = 48$ points, a 98% T confidence interval for $\mu$ is reported as $(490.2, 584.6)$.

(a) Identify the point estimate and margin of error of this interval.

(b) Re-create the 98% interval, but use a Z critical value from N(0, 1) instead of a T critical value.  How does this interval compare to $(490.2, 584.6)$?

(c) What assumptions/approximations are we making when we use a standard normal distribution to make inference on $\mu$?  Under what conditions would a Z confidence interval for $\mu$ be exact?
