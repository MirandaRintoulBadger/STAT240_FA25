# Preliminaries

- This file should be in `STAT240/discussion/ds04`.
- The file `food_donations.csv` should be in `STAT240/data`.
- This assignment should be completed in your discussion groups, which can be found on the "People" tab on Canvas.

The goal of today's discussion will be to use the `dplyr` data manipulation tools to answer a variety of different questions with the same starting dataset.

The animals of the UW-Madison Arboretum have collectively contributed to a winter food stockpile.  The dataset `food_donations` has one row per food contribution, with the following columns:

- `id`: a unique identifier for the food donation
- `name`: name of the individual making the donation
- `species`: species of the individual making the donation
- `species_diet`: the diet of the species, either herbivore or omnivore
- `food_type`: type of food donated
- `weight`: weight of food donated, in pounds
- `calories`: estimated calories contained in the donation
- `spoilage_time`: estimated number of days until the donated food spoils

The code below reads in the data and shows the first few rows.

```{r}
## This assumes that:
### STAT240/data/ contains the data file
### STAT240/discussion/ds04/ is your working directory.

donations <- read_csv("../../data/food_donations.csv")

head(donations)
```

Now, it's time for the food to be distributed according to who made the best contributions.  

Your group can either vouch for the **herbivores** or the **omnivores**.  For each of the following problems, complete the first step, then complete the sub-problem that corresponds to your chosen animal group.  The sub-problems will have less explicit guidance.


# Problem 1
#### (approx. 5 minutes)

How filling is the food that was donated?

Use `mutate` to add a new column to the data for the calorie density of each donation, measured as calories per 100 grams.  Use the conversion 1 pound = 454 grams.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
donations <- donations %>%
  mutate(calorie_density = calories / (weight * (454/100)))
```


# Problem 2
#### (approx. 15 minutes)

Which group acted more generously in terms of the number of donations?

Start by making a dataset that records the total number of donations per individual.

- First, use `group_by` to perform calculations for each individual.  To ensure that `species_diet` and `species` are present in the final dataset, you'll need to group by multiple columns.
- Next, use `summarize` to count the total number of donations per individual.
- Save this dataframe as `donations_summary`.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
donations_summary <- donations %>%
  group_by(species_diet, species, name) %>%
  summarize(total_donations = n())
```

The first few rows of the dataframe should look like this:
```
# Groups:   species_diet, species [7]
   species_diet species name     total_donations
   <chr>        <chr>   <chr>              <int>
 1 herbivore    beaver  Flapjack               4
 2 herbivore    beaver  Ginger                 3
 3 herbivore    beaver  Marco                  3
 4 herbivore    mouse   Abel                   8
```


## Herbivores

Use `donations_summary` to show that the herbivores made a greater number of donations on average *per species*.  This one is tricky - you'll need to use multiple calls to `group_by` and `summarize` to first perform calculations at the species level, then at the herbivore/omnivore level.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
donations_summary %>%
  group_by(species_diet, species) %>%
  summarize(species_total = sum(total_donations)) %>%
  group_by(species_diet) %>%
  summarize(species_avg = mean(species_total))
```


## Omnivores

Use `donations_summary` to show that the omnivores made a greater number of donations on average *per individual*.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
donations_summary %>%
  group_by(species_diet) %>%
  summarize(donations_per_individual = mean(total_donations))
```


# Problem 3
#### (approx. 10 minutes)

Which group contributed the most to food that will last a long time?

Let's make a smaller dataset that only contains donations that will last at least a month.
- Use `filter` to keep only the donations expected to last 30 days or more.
- Save this dataframe as `long_term_donations`.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
long_term_donations <- donations %>%
  filter(spoilage_time >= 30)
```

The dataframe `long_term_donations` should have 126 rows. 


## Herbivores

Use `long_term_donations` to show that the herbivores' long-term donations are, on average, more calorie dense than the omnivores' long-term donations.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
long_term_donations %>%
  group_by(species_diet) %>%
  summarize(avg_calorie_density = mean(calorie_density))
```


## Omnivores

Use `long_term_donations` to show that 7 out of 10 of the largest long-term donations (by weight) were made by omnivores.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
long_term_donations %>%
  slice_max(weight, n = 10) %>%
  arrange(species_diet)
```



# Problem 4
#### (approx. 15 minutes)

Which group contributed the greatest variety of food?

The code below creates a new dataset, `donations_by_type`, which records the number of herbivore, omnivore, and total donations for each of the food types.  We'll learn more about the command `pivot_wider` in a later lecture.

```{r}
donations_by_type <- donations %>%
  group_by(food_type, species_diet) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = species_diet, values_from = n,
              values_fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(total = herbivore + omnivore)

donations_by_type
```


## Herbivores

Use `donations_by_type` to show that the herbivores made most of the donations for the majority of the different food types.  There are a number of ways to do this, but you can consider making a new column indicating whether the herbivores or omnivores made the majority of donations.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
donations_by_type %>%
  mutate(mostly_herbivore = case_when(herbivore > omnivore ~ T,
                                      .default = F))
```


## Omnivores

Use `donations_by_type` to show that the omnivores contributed a greater number of unique food types.  This one is tricky - you may find it difficult to complete this problem only using `dplyr`.  Consider doing some initial manipulation with `dplyr`, then finishing the problem with a few base R manual calculations.

```{r, class.source="soln", class.output="soln"}
unique_donations <- donations_by_type %>%
  mutate(herbivore_donated = case_when(herbivore > 0 ~ T,
                                       .default = F),
         omnivore_donated = case_when(omnivore > 0 ~ T,
                                      .default = F))

# Complete the problem with base R
unique_herbivore_donations <- sum(unique_donations$herbivore_donated)
unique_omnivore_donations <- sum(unique_donations$omnivore_donated)

unique_herbivore_donations; unique_omnivore_donations
```
