# Preliminaries

-   This file should be in `STAT240/discussion/ds08`.
-   This assignment should be completed in your discussion groups, which can be found on the "People" tab on Canvas.

The goal of today's discussion will be to develop a stronger conceptual understanding of sampling distributions and confidence intervals.


# Final Project

The final project, to be completed in your usual discussion groups, has been assigned on Canvas.  Take a minute or two to exchange contact information and then start working on today's problems.


# Problem 1
#### (approx. 15 minutes)

The trading-card-game "WOW! WIZARD BATTLE!" is sold in packs of 15 randomized playing cards. $X$, the number of legendary wizard cards per pack, is a random variable with the following distribution.

| $x$        | 0   | 1   | 2    | 3    |
|:----------:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|
| $P(X = x)$ | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.15 | 0.05 |

Early in the day, a customer purchases 40 card packs from a store.  Later, another customer visits the same store and purchases the remaining 5 card packs.

(a) Match the six descriptions below to the appropriate sampling distribution histogram given in `ds08_histograms.png`.  Which of these statistics are approximately normal?

- $\bar{X}_{5}$, the average number of legendary wizards per pack across 5 packs
- $\bar{X}_{40}$, the average number of legendary wizards per pack across 40 packs
- $T_{5}$, the total number of legendary wizards in 5 packs
- $T_{40}$, the total number of legendary wizards in 40 packs
- $Min_{5}$, the minimum number of legendary wizards in a pack across 5 packs
- $Med_{40}$, the median number of wizards per pack across 40 packs

(b) The Central Limit Theorem says that, for a big enough sample size, the sample mean will have an approximately normal sampling distribution.  Explain why this normal approximation also true for the sample total.  *Consider the relationship between the sample mean and sample total*.

(c) Using what you discussed in (b), explain how the CLT allows a binomial random variable (with certain values of $n$ and $p$) to be approximated by a normal random variable.


# Problem 2
#### (approx. 10 minutes)

Continue working with the sample of 5 packs and the sample of 40 packs in problem 1.  Suppose each of these customers wants to use their respective sample to estimate $p = P(X = 1)$, the true proportion of packs with exactly one legendary wizard.  Each customer calculates a sample proportion $\hat{p}$ of how many of their packs contained exactly one legendary wizard.

(a) Without doing any calculation, which of the two customers will have a *biased* estimate of the true value of $p$?

(b) Without doing any calculation, which of the two customers will have less error in their estimation of the true $p$?

(c) Verify your answer to (b) by calculating the standard error of $\hat{p}$ for each customer:

$$\text{std. error of }\hat{p} \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$


# Problem 3
#### (approx. 25 minutes)

A politician claims that "half of all residents in my region worry about being a victim of crime." A random survey of $n = 100$ residents shows that $x = 45$ of them worry about being a victim of crime.

(a) Build a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of residents who are worried. Use the following formula, which can be viewed in ds08.html:

$$\text{estimate } \pm \text{ z value }\times \text{ standard error } \quad \rightarrow\quad \hat{p} \pm z \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$

Make sure your z value, calculated with `qnorm()`, reflects a confidence level of 95%, i.e. $\alpha = 0.05$.

(b) Does your confidence interval support the politician's claim?

(c) Let's create a fictitious population where exactly 48% of them are worried about being a victim of crime. The code below takes 10000 random samples of size 100, calculates the sample proportion of worried residents out of 100, and finds the upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval.

    Complete the code by writing in a line to calculate the margin of error (z-value times standard error), similar to what you did in part (a). You can use variables `phat` and `n` for the sample proportion and sample size. You don't need to change any other lines of code.

```{r, eval = F}
n <- 100
pop <- c(rep(0, 52), rep(1, 48)) # 48% of residents are worried (they have value 1)

iterations <- 10000
point_est <- numeric(iterations)
ci_lower <- numeric(iterations)
ci_upper <- numeric(iterations)

set.seed(240)
for(i in 1:iterations){
  samp <- sample(pop, size = 100, replace = T) # Sample 100 residents
  phat <- sum(samp)/100       # Find sample proportion who are worried
  
  #moe <-          # Add your code to calculate moe here!
    
  point_est[i] <- phat
  ci_lower[i] <- phat - moe    # Lower bound of CI
  ci_upper[i] <- phat + moe    # Upper bound of CI
}

intervals <- tibble(point_est, ci_lower, ci_upper)
```

(d) After completing part (c), you should have a dataset called `intervals` with 10000 rows that has the lower and upper bound of 10000 theoretical CIs made from samples of 100. Use dplyr to mutate a new column that labels whether the interval covers the true value of 0.48. Then, calculate the proportion of intervals that cover 0.48.

(e) Now, instead of the true proportion 0.48, consider the politician's claim of a proportion 0.5. Based on the simulation, if the true proportion is actually 0.48, what is the probability that a random sample of 100 will support the claim of a proportion of 0.5?
